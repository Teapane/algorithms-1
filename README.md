##Linked Lists

 * Ruby

 * * __Minitest__ - To work on learning about linked lists in Ruby, I first used minitest to TDD the process of building a linked list and applying specific behaviors to it. I started with counting the nodes in the list and adding and removing a node from the end. Then I added the push, pop, shift and unshift methods, as well as inserting a node before and after a specific index.
 
   * __Rspec__ - I took the behaviors as listed above and started the process over to TDD the list with rspec.

 * Javascript - I extended what I learned about linked lists in ruby by writing a test suite in Jasmine to TDD the linked list in Javascript.
