##Word Problem

 * __Ruby__ - *minitest*
   
   * Extends the existing exercism.io problem "wordy" to include an order of operations condition. Word Problem takes in an equation as a string with the operands as words (ex: "What is 1 plus 3 multiplied by 6") Originally, the equations were evaluated left to right. I wanted to add more functionality when set to *true*, the multiplication and division subsections of the equation are evaluated first (similar to PEMDAS).

##Binary Search Tree

 * __Ruby__ - *minitest*

##Linked Lists

 * __Ruby__

   * __minitest__ - To work on learning about linked lists in Ruby, I used minitest to TDD the process of building a linked list and to apply specific behaviors to it. I started with counting the nodes in the list and adding and removing a node from the end. Then I added the push, pop, shift and unshift methods, as well as inserting a node before and after a specific index.
 
   * __RSpec__ - I took the behaviors as listed above and started the process over to TDD the list with RSpec.

 * __Javascript__ - I extended what I learned about linked lists in ruby by writing a test suite in Jasmine to TDD the linked list in Javascript.
